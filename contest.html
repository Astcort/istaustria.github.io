    In an initiative to help support the participation of European students at
    the 2017 SIGGRAPH conference, the Institute of Science and Technology (IST)
    Austria is launching a competition to support strong European SIGGRAPH
    volunteers with travel funds to and from the 2018 SIGGRAPH Conference.

    All students currently enrolled at institutions in Europe who are also
    applying to the SIGGRAPH volunteers program are eligible to apply. Note that students
    have to apply for both programs, the SIGGRAPH volunteers program and the IST Austria travel award, separately.
    Our application uses similar materials as the SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer application. All applicants will be asked to provide a current transcript (official or unofficial) or an
    enrollment verification letter from your institution's registrar, the name
    of the school and program you are currently enrolled in, expected
    graduation year, and a short statement answering the following two
    questions:

    1. The SIGGRAPH Conference is the premier international event on computer
    graphics and interactive techniques. The SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program
    brings in students from all over the world each year who are passionate
    about computer graphics, service-oriented, and inspired to be the industry
    leaders of tomorrow.Tell us why you would like to be considered for
    participation in the SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program. What interests you
    about SIGGRAPH in particular, and why would you be a good fit for our team
    this year?

    2. SIGGRAPH brings in thousands of attendees from all over the world every
    year. Student Volunteers play a very crucial role in helping attendees to
    have a worthwhile conference experience. Because of this, Student
    Volunteers must exhibit a very strong ability to work with a wide range of
    cultural differences. Tell us about a time when you interacted with
    individuals from a different background than your own, and outline what you
    learned from your experience.

    All application materials should be sent as a single pdf to
    siggraphsvcontest@ist.ac.at no later than Jan 10th 2017.  More information about
    the [SIGGRAPH volunteers program can be found here](http://s2017.siggraph.org/student-volunteers).

    Application materials will be reviewed by IST Austria Computer Graphics
    faculty [Bernd Bickel](http://berndbickel.com/) and [Chris Wojtan](
    http://pub.ist.ac.at/group_wojtan/). Applicants will be evaluated on the
    potential for a career in Computer Graphics. Consideration will be
    conditional on acceptance to the SIGGRAPH volunteers program, and priority
    will be given to students studying towards their bachelor's or master's
    degrees in a computer graphics-related field. The winners of the
    competition will be awarded with travel funds of up to 1000 euros to cover
    the costs of transportation and accommodation at the conference. Candidates
    will be notified of the outcome of the competition latest in May.

    For questions, please contact [siggraphsvcontest@ist.ac.at](mailto:siggraphsvcontest@ist.ac.at).

    Previous year winners:
    Annemieke Verbraeck from TU Delft (2017), Domna Banakou from University of Barcelona (2016).
