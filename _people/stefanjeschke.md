bio: |
 I got my M.Sc. in 2001 and a Ph.D. in 2005, both in computer science from the University of Rostock, Germany.  Afterwards, I spend several years as a post doc researcher in projects at Vienna University of Technology, Arizona State University and IST Austria.  My research interest includes modeling and display of vectorized image representations, applications and solvers for PDEs, as well as modeling and rendering complex natural phenomena, preferably in real time.
