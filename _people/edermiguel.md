bio:
  I obtained my PhD. in November 2014 at [Rey Juan Carlos University] (http://www.urjc.es/) as part of the [Modeling and Virtual Reality Group] (http://www.gmrv.es/), where I worked on modeling and estimation of hyperelasticity and deformation models. My PhD. mentor was [Miguel A. Otaduy] (http://www.gmrv.es/~motaduy/). Previously I also worked on algorithms for contact simulation between rigid and deformable bodies. My research focuses on physically-based simulation (including data-driven approaches) and its application to computational design and digital fabrication.
