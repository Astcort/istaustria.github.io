  I am currently a postdoc researcher at IST Austria in [Chris Wojta Group](http://pub.ist.ac.at/group_wojtan/). I am interested in physics-based simulation and modeling natural phenoma as well as geometric modeling. I obtained my PhD in 2016 at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, supervised by Stefanie Hahmann and Damien Rohmer of the Imagine Team. I got an Engenieering Degree in 2013 from the school ENSIMAG (Grenoble INP) of Grenoble, France.
