bio:
  I got my B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Tokyo, and I'm now a master student in computer graphics under the supervision of Takeo Igarashi (expecting M.Sc. in Computer Science in March, 2017). I was mainly working on virtual reality and fluid simulation so far. My current research interests are physics-based simulation, computer vision and applied math.
