abstract: |
  We present a computational method for designing wire sculptures
  consisting of interlocking wires. Our method allows the computation
  of aesthetically pleasing structures that are structurally stable,
  efficiently fabricatable with a 2D wire bending machine, and assemblable
  without the need of additional connectors. Starting from a set of
  planar contours provided by the user, our method automatically tests
  for the feasibility of a design, determines a discrete ordering of
  wires at intersection points, and optimizes for the rest shape of
  the individual wires to maximize structural stability under frictional
  contact. In addition to their application to art, wire sculptures
  present an extremely efficient and fast alternative for low-fidelity
  rapid prototyping because manufacturing time and required material
  linearly scales with the physical size of objects. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach on a varied set of examples,
  all of which we fabricated.

    Given a set of planar input contours (left), our system computes(right)
    can be easily fabricated using a 2D wire bending machine anda stable, self-supporting
    wire sculpture. The physical prototype assembled without the need of connectors
    between crossing wires.
