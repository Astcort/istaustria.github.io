abstract: |
  We present an efficient wavefront tracking algorithm for animating bodies
of water that interact with their environment. Our contributions include: a
novel wavefront tracking technique that enables dispersion, refraction, reflection,
and diffraction in the same simulation; a unique multivalued function
interpolation method that enables our simulations to elegantly sidestep
the Nyquist limit; a dispersion approximation for efficiently amplifying the
number of simulated waves by several orders of magnitude; and additional
extensions that allow for time-dependent effects and interactive artistic editing
of the resulting animation. Our contributions combine to give us multitudes
more wave details than similar algorithms, while maintaining high
frame rates and allowing close camera zooms.
