    We are participating in the EU project [SOMA soft manipulation](http://www.softmanipulation.eu/). Our role is to develop computational methods that support the 
	exploration of a new avenue of robotic manipulation, exploiting the physical constraints imposed by the 
	environment to enable robust grasping and manipulation in dynamic, open, and highly variable contexts.
